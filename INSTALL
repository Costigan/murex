## Required dependencies

    go get -u github.com/chzyer/readline
    go get -u github.com/Knetic/govaluate

Explanation behind these dependencies:
* `readline` is used for the REPL (interactive mode)
* `govaluate` evaluates the math formulas (exposed via `eval` and `let`)

## Optional dependencies

    go get -u labix.org/v2/mgo/bson
    go get -u github.com/abesto/sexp
    go get -u gopkg.in/yaml.v2
    go get -u github.com/BurntSushi/toml

Explanation behind these dependencies:
* `bson` is used to add support for BSON (binary JSON) (as used by MongoDB)
* `sexp` adds support for s-expressions and canonical s-expressions
* `yaml` adds support for YAML
* `toml` adds support for TOML

If you wish do disable any of these then delete the appropriate files in
the `builtins` directory of this project or append `// +build ignore` to
the `.go` file if you wish to preserve the change in subsequent updates
from git.

## Build

    go build github.com/lmorg/murex

Test the binary (requires Bash and `timeout`):

    test/regression_test.sh

A Dockerfile is also included for your convenience. The file is located
in test/docker and includes a test/docker/README.md with more information.
