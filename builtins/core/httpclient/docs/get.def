### Detail

#### JSON return

`get` returns a JSON object with the following fields:

    {
        "Status": {
            "Code": integer,
            "Message": string,
        },
        "Headers": {
            string [
                string...
            ]
        },
        "Body": string
    }

The concept behind this is it provides and easier path for scripting eg pulling
specific fields via the index, `[`, function.

#### `get` as a method

Running `get` as a method will transmit the contents of STDIN as part of the
body of the HTTP GET request. When run as a method you have to include a second
parameter specifying the Content-Type MIME.

#### Configurable options

`get` has a number of behavioral options which can be configured via _murex_'s
standard `config` tool:

    config: -> [ http ]

To change a default, for example the user agent string:

    config: set http user-agent "bob"
    get: google.com

This enables sane, repeatable and readable defaults. Read the documents on
`config` for more details about it's usage and the rational behind the command.
