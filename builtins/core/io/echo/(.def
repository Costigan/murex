### Detail

The `(` function performs exactly like the `(` token for quoting so you do not
need to escape other tokens (eg single / double quotes, `'`/`"`, nor curly
braces, `{}`). However the braces are nestable so you will need to escape those
characters if you don't want them nested.

#### ANSI Constants

`(` supports ANSI constants.
