### Description

Write parameters to the OS STDOUT (bypassing STDOUT along the _murex_ pipeline).

### Usage

    print: string to write

### Examples

    Â» print Hello, World!
    Hello, World!

### Detail

This is a throwaway function for edge cases. Generally all problems should be
solvable using `out` or _murex_ named pipes (`pipe`).

> Please note: because this function writes directly to the OS's STDOUT,
  redirection will not work with `print`.
