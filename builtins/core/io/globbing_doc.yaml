    Lists objects (eg files) in the current working directory
  Description: |-
    Lists objects (eg files) in the current working directory.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    f: options -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    # return only directories:
    f: +d

    # return file and directories but exclude symlinks:
    f: +d +f -s
    ```
  Flags:
    f: files
    d: directories
    s: symlinks (automatically included with files and directories)
  Detail: |-
    By default `f` will return no results. It is then your responsibility to select
    which types of objects to be included or excluded from the results.

    Glob pattern matching for file system objects (eg *.txt)
  Description: |-
    Returns a list of files and directories that match a glob pattern.

    Output is a JSON list.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    g: pattern -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    # inline globbing
    cat: @{ g: *.txt }

    # writing a JSON array of files to disk
    g: *.txt -> > filelist.json

    # writing a list of files to disk
    g: *.txt -> format str -> > filelist.txt

    # checking if a file exists
    if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file exists
    }

    # checking if a file does not exist
    !if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file does not exist
    }
    ```
  Detail: |-
    #### Pattern reference

    * `*` matches any number of (including zero) characters
    * `?` matches any single character

    #### Auto-globbing

    Any command prefixed with `@g` will be auto-globbed. For example, the two
    following commands will produce the same output:

    ```
    » ls @{g: *.go}
    benchmarks_test.go  defaults_test.go  flags.go  godoc.go  main.go  murex_test.go

    » @g ls *.go
    benchmarks_test.go  defaults_test.go  flags.go  godoc.go  main.go  murex_test.go
    ```

    The rational behind the ugly `@g` syntax is simply to make one-liners a bit
    less painful when coming from more traditional POSIX-like shells (eg Bash)
    where wildcards are automatically expanded. So if you type `ls *` (for example)
    then realise you've forgotten to subshell, you can just recall the last command
    with auto-globbing enabled:
    
    ```
    @g ^!!
    ```

    `rx`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Regexp pattern matching for file system objects (eg '.*\.txt')
  Description: |-
    Returns a list of files and directories that match a regexp pattern.

    Output is a JSON list.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    rx: pattern -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    # inline regex file matching
    cat: @{ rx: '.*\.txt' }

    # writing a list of files to disk
    rx: '.*\.go' -> > filelist.txt

    # checking if any files exist
    if { rx: somefiles.* } then {
        # files exist
    }

    # checking if no files exist
    !if { rx: somefiles.* } then {
        # files do not exist
    }
    ```
  Detail: |-
    Unlike globbing (`g`) which can traverse directories (eg `g: /path/*`), `rx` is
    only designed to match file system objects in the current working directory.

    `rx` uses Go (lang)'s standard regexp engine.
