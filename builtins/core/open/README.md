# Builtins: open

This opens various data formats inside the command line interface.

It is a recommended builtin and has additional dependencies:

    go get -u golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal
    go get -u github.com/disintegration/imaging
    go get -u golang.org/x/image/bmp
    go get -u golang.org/x/image/tiff
    go get -u golang.org/x/image/webp

However these are included in the `vendor` directory
