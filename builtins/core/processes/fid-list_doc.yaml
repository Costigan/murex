  Detail: |-
    Because _murex_ is a multi-threaded shell, builtins are not forked processes
    like in a traditional / POSIX shell. This means that you cannot use the
    operating systems default process viewer (eg `ps`) to list _murex_ functions.
    This is where `fid-list` comes into play. It is used to view all the functions
    and processes that are managed by the current _murex_ session. That would
    include:
    * any aliases within _murex_
    * public and private _murex_ functions
    * builtins (eg `fid-list` is a builtin command)
    * any external processes that were launched from within this shell session
    * any background functions or processes of any of the above
