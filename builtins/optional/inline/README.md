# Package `inline`

This allows you to inline code from other languages.

However the code is incomplete and the feature may even be dropped entirely
from future releases of _murex_.

If you wish this feature to be finished and preserved then please leave a
comment on _murex_'s issue tracker (https://github.com/lmorg/murex) and/or
submit any pull requests.
