    `sleep` is very simplistic - particularly when compared to its GNU coreutil
    (for example) counterpart. If you want to use the `sleep` binary on Linux
    or similar platforms then you will need to launch with the `exec` builtin:

    ```
    » exec: sleep 5
    ```

    Returns the execution run time of a command or block
  Description: |-
    `time` is an optional builtin which runs a command or block of code and
    returns it's running time.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    time: command parameters -> <stderr>

    time: { code-block } -> <stderr>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » time: sleep 5
    5.000151513

    » time { out "Going to sleep"; sleep 5; out "Waking up" }
    Going to sleep
    Waking up
    5.000240977
    ```
  Detail: |-
    `time`'s output is written to STDERR. However any output and errors written
    by the commands executed by time will also be written to `time`'s STDOUT
    and STDERR as usual.
