# _murex_ Language Guide

## Data-Type Reference

This section is a catalogue of data-types which _murex_ is natively aware.

Since not all date-types are equal, you may find some features missing in
some data-types which are present in others. If in doubt then refer to
the manual here or check the API manual for more details about specific
hooks.
