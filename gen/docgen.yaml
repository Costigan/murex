    Title: Command Reference
    Description: |-
      This section is a catalogue of _murex_ functions (builtin commands). Because
      _murex_ is loosely modelled on the functional paradigm, it means all language
      constructs are exposed via functions and those are typically builtins since
      they can share the _murex_ runtime virtual machine.

      However any executable command can also be called from within _murex_; be
      that either via the `exec` builtin or natively like you would from any Linux,
      UNIX, or even Windows command prompt.
