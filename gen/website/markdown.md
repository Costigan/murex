This is a test page to view how markdown gets rendered to HTML

Some wrappy text with **bold text** _emphasised text_ and
`inlined monospaced text` embedded within it.

```
while { true } {
    out: "This is only a test"
}
```

```go
for {
    fmt.Printf("This is only a test)
}
```

> Some quoted text

1. numbers
2. more numbers
3. yet more numbers

- bullet point
- another bullet point
- yet more bullet points

* alternative bullet point
* another bullet point
* yet more bullet points
