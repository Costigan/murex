    STDERR Pipe (`?`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Pipes STDERR from the left hand command to STDIN of the right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token swaps the STDOUT and STDERR streams of the left hand command.

    Please note that this token is only effective when it is prefixed by white
    space. 
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » err Hello, world! ? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
    ```

    In following example the first command is writing to STDOUT rather than STDERR
    so `Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:
    
    ```
    » out Hello, world! ? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!
    ```

    In following example the STDERR token isn't whitespace padded so is treated
    like any ordinary printable character:

    ```
    » err Hello, world!? regexp s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!? regexp s/world/Earth/
    ```
