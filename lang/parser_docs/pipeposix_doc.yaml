  Title: >-
    POSIX Pipe (`|`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Pipes STDOUT from the left hand command to STDIN of the right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token behaves much like pipe would in Bash or similar shells. It passes
    STDOUT along the pipeline while merging STDERR stream with the parents STDERR
    stream.

    It is identical in purpose to the `->` pipe token.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out: Hello, world! | regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!

    » out: Hello, world!|regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, Earth!
    ```

    In this example the first command is writing to STDERR rather than STDOUT so
    `Hello, world!` doesn't get pipelined and thus isn't affected by `regexp`:
    
    ```
    » err: Hello, world! | regexp: s/world/Earth/
    Hello, world!
    ```
