  Title: >-
    Formatted Pipe (`=>`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Pipes a reformatted STDOUT stream from the left hand command to STDIN of the
    right hand command
  Description: |-
    This token behaves much like the `->` pipe would except it injects `format
    generic` into the pipeline. The purpose of a formatted pipe is to support
    piping out to external commands which don't support _murex_ data types. For
    example they might expect arrays as lists rather than JSON objects).
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » ja: [Mon..Wed] => cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed
    ```

    The above is literally the same as typing:

    ```
    » ja: [Mon..Wed] -> format generic -> cat
    Mon
    Tue
    Wed
    ```

    To demonstrate how the previous pipeline might look without a formatted pipe:
    
    ```
    » ja: [Mon..Wed] -> cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja: [Mon..Wed] | cat
    ["Mon","Tue","Wed"]

    » ja: [Mon..Wed]
    [
        "Mon",
        "Tue",
        "Wed"
    ]
    ```
