// docgen is a tool for auto-generating technical documents
//
// The purpose of this tool is to automate documentation as much as possible
// and have the output a static CMS which can be hosted on GitHub or S3
// (depending on whether your templates are markdown or HTML).
//
// This project is designed to be run independently from murex and at some
// point it will be separated into it's own git repository (at a stage when I
// am confident that murex will no longer be the primary driver for features,
// bugs or other code changes)
